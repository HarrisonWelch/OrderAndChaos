# Order and Choas #

## Description

This an Android project where the old 1981 board game called "[Order and Chaos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_and_Chaos)" invented by Stephen Sniderman. Order and Chaos is basically tic-tac-toe but with some major differences. Both players control both pieces "X" and "O" and only Order wins with a row, column, or diagonal of 5 peices of the same type. Choas wins if all the spots on the board are filled up and Order never won.
